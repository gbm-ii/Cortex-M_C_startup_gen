# Cortex-M C startup generator
The program creates the C source file containing the exception vectors, startup routine and dummy exception handler.
The startup module is generated based on the MCU-specific header file, usually supplied by the MCU vendor.
The exception names are taken from the definition of enum type defining the MCU-specific xxx_IRQn constants.
The resulting `startup_xxx.c` file is compatible with gcc-arm-embedded and follows the section naming convention used by ST Microelectronics' STM32CubeIDE in the linker script files generated by it.
The program accepts three options influencing its operation:

`-i` option causes the definition of interrupt handlers for NVIC interrupts not defined in the MCU header files. This allows for using these interrupts for software-triggered event handlers. The ISRs have the names containing the IRQ number, like `IRQ12_IRQHandler`.

`-n maxIRQn` option enables the definition of extra IRQ handlers beyond the last IRQ defined for a given MCU. `maxIRQ` is the IRQn of the last interrupt to be defined.
  
`-s` option forces the output of standard, shortened names of core exception handlers, like `SVC_Handler`, instead of names taken from IRQn names, like `SVCall_Handler`.

**Example:**

`h2cstartup -s stm32f401xc.h`
  
creates `startup_stm32f401xc.c` file, which may successfully replace the `startup_stm32f401xx.s` file originally created by STM32CubeIDE.

The motivation behind creating the code was to get rid of the assembly startup file and to make it convenient to use the NVIC interrupts non-defined in the given MCU for software-generated event handling.
